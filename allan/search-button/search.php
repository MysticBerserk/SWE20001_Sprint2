            Create a connection to link the database to our search form
            Create a variable that allows the system to select all values in the table '-----'
            After creating the variable, make a query and a fetch function to fetch the data selected and display it.
            Now, again back to search
            with the connection already created, create another variable to select values in the table that are related to user input
            Display it in a different page
